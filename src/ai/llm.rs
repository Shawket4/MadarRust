//! The LLM transport boundary.
//!
//! This trait carries **no domain knowledge**. It moves messages and tool
//! definitions to a model and brings back either text or tool calls — nothing
//! about reports, metrics or restaurants appears here.
//!
//! That is deliberate. In the previous design the trait had domain methods
//! (`choose_report`, `summarize`), which meant every new capability cost one new
//! method times every provider, and the providers drifted. With a transport
//! boundary, a new capability is one entry in [`super::tools`] and every
//! provider gets it for free.
